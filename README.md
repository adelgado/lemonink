Lemonink
========

Lemonink is the first iteration of a platform whose objetive is to be an *anonymized resilient peer-to-peer locally-non-persistent forum*.

What does that mean?


Anonymized
----------

Anonymized means that the forum users should be able to remain anonymous if they chose to do so.


Resilient
---------

Resilient means that no data must exist only in one place at a time, thus guaranteeing that the network can withstand the loss of peers without losing data.


Peer-to-peer
------------

Peer-to-peer means that to achieve our goals each user will act as both a client and a server, passing data around the network as needed. The system must be built in such a way that the balance between incoming and outgoing traffic on any one user must head towards a balance.


Locally-non-persistent
----------------------

Locally-non-persistent means that no data should ever be persistently stored on any node. Persistent storage means storage that remains able to be read even after it has had its power cut. Solid State Drives (SSD), Hard Disks (HD) and USB drives are thus persistent storage. Memory, on the other hand, need electricity to store data, and is thusly non-persistent. This way, nothing is stored on an users' drive, and simply cutting the power erases all the local data.


Forum
-----

A forum is a place where people exchange information. Since the tradicional roman gathering place until today with digital forums, it has always symbolized in one way or another the discussion and introduction of change through the exchange of information. We aim to serve this proud tradition.
